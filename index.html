I was encouraged to </span><span>enroll by a former student of theirs </span><span>who can only say wonderful things </span><span>about the program. The entire </span><span>curriculum and staff did not </span><span>disappoint. They were very hands-on </span><span>and I never had to wait long for </span><span>assistance. The agile team project, in </span><span>particular, was outstanding. It took </span><span>my learning to the next level in a way </span><span>that no tutorial could ever have. In </span><span>fact, I've often referred to it during </span><span>interviews as an example of my </span><span>developent experience. It certainly </span><span>helped me land a job as a full-stack </span><span>developer after receiving multiple </span><span>offers. 100% recommend! "</span></p>
